# Weather App ⛅

This is a small weather app created in React JS using the OpenWeatherMap API.

With this app you can enter the name of any city in the world and check the current weather.

The app will show you:
- The temperature in celcius, also the min temp, and max temp.
- The humidity
- A description of the weather in general


And that's it! 🌩️🌩️🌩️
