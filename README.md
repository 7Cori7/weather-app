# Weather App ⛅

This is a small weather app created in React JS using the OpenWeatherMap API and the Geolocation API.

With this app you can enter the name of any city in the world and check the current weather.
Also, if you allow geolocation permits, it will show you the weather depending on your location.

The app will show you:
- The temperature in celcius, also the min temp, and max temp.
- The humidity
- A description of the weather in general
- Depending on the weather, the theme colors of the app will change.

And that's it! 🌩️🌩️🌩️
